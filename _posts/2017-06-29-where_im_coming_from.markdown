One of my first "adult" jobs was writing technical articles for an online manufacturing database. This web company was producing an archive of manufacturing guides intended for purchasers at manufacturing companies, or for small-business owners looking for more information about manufacturing processes they might want to contract jobs.

I got the job through a friend of mine and based solely on my writing ability. I didn't know much about manufacturing at the time, or the ins and outs of being a technical writer. There was a steep curve getting to competence, but I managed to climb over a huge amount of information--about machining, explosive waterforming, additive manufacturing, and more--in order to start cranking out articles for this database. For three years, I wrote these technical guides.

After three years, this project transitioned into a more journalism-based venture--I'd interview small manufacturers or machine tool production representatives about their new technologies and write them up. I was eventually laid off when my company adopted a low-cost content production model.

I then got a job in publishing, where I worked as a production editor managing the process of converting hardcover books to trade paperbacks. I learned a lot about editing in this job, and maintained a system of sticking to deadlines and working in a fast-moving team that offered very little wiggle room.

But the career ladder was rundleless. There was nowhere to go. I decided to actively pursue a computer science education to open up career opportunities for myself. I studied a variety of programming languages, interned at a small gaming company, and produced some low level apps of my own. I began looking for junior developer jobs, but despite scoring a number of phone screens, a few coding tests, and some callbacks, I simply could not get a job. Frankly: it stunk, and I was growing a little hopeless. 

I have started studying at Flatiron to broaden my career prospects. Getting a more formal education in programming topics is helpful, and allows me to explain topics with a proper lexicon. I am primarily pleased with the project-based curriculum, so that I can produce a Github account worth a hiring manager's time.
